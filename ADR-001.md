ADR 001: Adopt TypeScript for Frontend Development

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-01-23
Author(s): Tuaseen

Context:

Our frontend team currently uses JavaScript (ES6+) for all web applications. As the codebase grows, we are experiencing issues with maintainability, type-related runtime errors, and inconsistent API contracts between frontend and backend.

The team wants to improve code reliability, enforce stricter type safety, and make refactoring safer for large-scale projects.

Decision:

We will adopt TypeScript for all new frontend development and gradually migrate existing JavaScript code to TypeScript.

Key points of the decision:

Configure tsconfig.json with strict mode enabled.

Use TypeScript with React functional components and hooks.

Gradually migrate existing JS files using .ts/.tsx extensions and allowJs in tsconfig.json.

Integrate TypeScript checks into CI/CD pipeline (npm run build fails on type errors).

Consequences:

Positive:

Improved type safety reduces runtime errors.

Better editor support (IntelliSense, autocomplete).

Easier refactoring and maintainability.

Alignment with backend type contracts when using shared types.

Negative / Trade-offs:

Initial learning curve for developers unfamiliar with TypeScript.

Requires additional tooling and build configuration.

Slight increase in compile time for large projects.

Mitigation:

Conduct internal workshops on TypeScript basics.

Introduce gradual migration strategy, converting only critical modules first.

Enforce TypeScript linting and formatting rules using ESLint and Prettier.

Alternatives Considered:

Stay with plain JavaScript – Rejected. Issues with runtime type errors persist.

Use Flow for static typing – Rejected. TypeScript has stronger community support, better tooling, and broader adoption.
