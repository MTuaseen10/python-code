ADR 002: Adopt PostgreSQL as Primary Database

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-01-23
**Author(s):** Tuaseen

Context:

The application requires a reliable, scalable, and ACID-compliant relational database to store structured data, including user accounts, project metadata, ADRs, and audit logs.

Current options considered: MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. The team needs:

* Strong support for relational integrity and transactions.
* Advanced querying capabilities (joins, aggregations).
* Good performance at moderate to large scale.
* Active community support and long-term maintainability.

Decision:

We will adopt **PostgreSQL** as our primary database for all core application data.

Key points of the decision:

* Use PostgreSQL 16.x as the official version.
* Deploy via managed service (AWS RDS / Aurora) for high availability and automated backups.
* Implement connection pooling via `pg-pool` in Node.js backend.
* Enforce schema migrations using `Drizzle-kit` / `Prisma` for versioned changes.
* Use indexes, constraints, and foreign keys to maintain data integrity.

Consequences:

**Positive:**

* ACID-compliant database ensures consistency for critical business data.
* Rich query capabilities and support for complex joins.
* Strong community support and active ecosystem.
* Compatibility with ORMs and migration tools.

**Negative / Trade-offs:**

* Slightly higher operational complexity compared to simpler NoSQL solutions.
* Requires schema management and migration discipline.
* Scaling horizontally (sharding) is more complex than some NoSQL databases.

**Mitigation:**

* Use managed cloud database to reduce operational overhead.
* Implement automated testing for migrations.
* Monitor database performance and optimize indexes/queries regularly.

Alternatives Considered:

1. **MySQL** – Rejected. Slightly weaker support for advanced data types and JSON features.
2. **MongoDB** – Rejected. Schema-less design unsuitable for strong relational constraints, joins, and transactional requirements.
3. **SQLite** – Rejected. Not suitable for production-level concurrent workloads.
