# ADR 004: Adopt GitHub Actions for CI/CD Pipeline

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-01-23
**Author(s):** Tuaseen

## Context

The application requires automated build, test, and deployment workflows to ensure:

* Consistent quality across all environments.
* Fast feedback on pull requests.
* Automated deployments with rollback capability.
* Integration with containerized services (Docker/Kubernetes).

Current options considered include Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and CircleCI. The team wants minimal operational overhead, tight GitHub integration, and cost-effective execution.

## Decision

We will adopt **GitHub Actions** for the CI/CD pipeline.

Key points of the decision:

* Define workflows in `.github/workflows/` directory using YAML.
* Pipelines include stages: build, test, lint, Docker image build, and deploy to Kubernetes.
* Use caching strategies (e.g., node_modules, Docker layers) to optimize build time.
* Use environment secrets and GitHub Environments for secure credentials.
* Enforce mandatory CI checks before merging pull requests.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

* Native integration with GitHub repository and pull requests.
* Easy setup with minimal infrastructure overhead.
* Flexible matrix builds for multiple environments.
* Free or low-cost tier for small to medium workloads.

**Negative / Trade-offs:**

* Limited control over execution environment compared to self-hosted Jenkins.
* Large pipelines may hit GitHub Actions usage limits.
* Less flexibility for highly customized orchestration.

**Mitigation:**

* Use self-hosted runners for resource-intensive builds.
* Monitor usage and optimize workflow steps.
* Split workflows for independent services to reduce job time.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Jenkins** – Rejected. High operational overhead; requires dedicated server and maintenance.
2. **GitLab CI** – Rejected. Not tightly integrated with GitHub; would require cross-platform integration.
3. **CircleCI** – Rejected. Paid plan costs higher for larger build volumes.
